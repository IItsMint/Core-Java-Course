// Eventhough we did not write class  here we wrote it in another file and with compile, we obtained .class file
//we can create a new object from a class file

// it can be interwiev quesiton !!!! java does not support multiple inheritance !!!!!!!!!!!!!

//If we made class overlading, and want to use both of the classes for the  same method name, we can use this(); and super(); com√∂mands.
//this makes use the whole class with the same name while super use the parent (extend) class.

//we can override the methods, every obj wants so print itself, so we can overwrite them by selecting the obj from what we want.
